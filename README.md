# Simulation_Methods

Like I wrote in the description. This is a repo for all the different laborations I am having in a simulation course. The simulation course goes through different numerical methods used in Biomedical Engineering in various field. At the moment of writing, it's been mostly solving PDE's

The course is called Simulation Methods in Biomedical Engineering
